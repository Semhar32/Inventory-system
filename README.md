# Inventory System Project

## Overview
This project is an inventory system that allows you to add, update, delete, and filter items. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript objects and array functions for data manipulation.

## Functions
- **addItem(item)**: Adds a new item to the inventory.
- **updateItem(id, updatedItem)**: Updates the item with the given id.
- **deleteItem(id)**: Deletes the item with the given id.
- **filterByCategory(category)**: Returns items in the specified category.
- **filterByMinQuantity(minQuantity)**: Returns items with a quantity greater than or equal to the specified minimum quantity.
- **getItemNames()**: Returns an array of item names.
- **calculateTotalValue()**: Returns the total value of the inventory.
- **printInventory()**: Prints all items in the inventory.

## Challenges
- Ensuring the immutability of the original inventory array during updates.
- Efficiently filtering and summarizing items.

## Best Practices
- Descriptive function names and consistent coding style.
- Thorough commenting to explain logic and approach.

## Testing
- Console logs were used to verify the correctness of functions.
- Edge cases were considered and tested.
